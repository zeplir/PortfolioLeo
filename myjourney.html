        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>My coding journey started in 2023, when I was studying sales and marketing, oddly enough. 
            One year in to the course I realized that sales was not quite for me. What I wanted to do was problem solving, 
            hence I got interested in programming.
        </p>
        <p>I then decided between JS or C as a starting language, 
            and decided that C would fit me better. So I dropped out of sales and started my journey at Chas academy C/C++.
            It was scary, but a nessecary leap of faith that I am so happy I took, since I have fallen in love 
            with programming.
        </p>
        <p>At first it was quite hard, however I pushed through and I am so happy I did, since I managed to land a job
            at Elsystem. The job at Elsystem is honestly amazing and I have learned so much not only about programming,
            but also about the industry in general. And I really look forward to learning a lot more.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time I like to go for walks with my two dogs Dibley and Oggi, work on coding projects and go to the gym.
            Since I spend more time behind a computer now because of school and my job, I have found the gym to be a 
            really nice place to be, it really helps me feel better and I believe it makes me a better programmer.
